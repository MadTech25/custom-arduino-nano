# Custom Arduino Nano Board

This project showcases a custom-built Arduino Nano-compatible board, designed and assembled from individual components for electronics prototyping and embedded development.

## 🛠️ Hardware Features

- Full pin headers for easy breadboard and jumper wire use
- Tactile reset button mounted to PCB
- 2.1mm barrel jack for external 9–12V power supply
- Pre-programmed ATmega328P chip (or ready to program)
- Onboard crystal oscillator
- Soldered terminal pins for all digital, analog, power, and serial lines

## 📷 Photos

_Add photos of the board here once available_

## 🚧 Programming Status

- ATmega328P installed, not yet fully programmed
- Future plans:
  - Upload bootloader using Arduino as ISP
  - Load basic sketches (blinking LED, serial monitor tests)
